# Variational_Auto_Encoder

The key is to notice that any distribution in d dimensions can be generated by taking a set of d variables that are normally distributed and mapping them through a sufficiently complicated function. 

In Variational Auto Encoder our objective function 
we are aiming maximize the probability of each X in the training set under the entire generative process, according to:
