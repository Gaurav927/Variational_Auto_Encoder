## Basic knowledge to understand VAE in better way 
The key is to notice that any distribution in d dimensions can be generated by taking a set of d variables that are normally distributed and mapping them through a sufficiently complicated function. For example, say we wanted to construct a 2D random variable whose values lie on a ring. If z is 2D and normally distributed, g ( z ) = z/10 + z/ || z || is roughly a ring
